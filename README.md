For this homework, the tricky part was managing the allocated data within case 1 (adding a student). This is challenging because, after defining the buffer whose memory is stored on the stack, we want it to persist outside of its scope (the switch case). To achieve this, we dynamically allocate memory on the heap for each student, making sure to allocate enough space for both the original string and the null terminator, which strcpy accounts for. At the end of the program, we also have to delete each allocated string from the names array to prevent memory leaks.

We passed the size parameter by reference to ensure it stays consistent throughout the program, and we passed GPA by reference to avoid passing by value and creating unnecessary copies. In the updateGpa function, we used pointers to directly update the value the pointer references, avoiding additional allocations or data copying. Lastly, exceptions were handled by the functions that modified pointers or important parameters like size. When an exception occurred, we returned a string to ensure it was handled properly and did not terminate the program.
